# Linux MAC Changer

## What is this script?

This is a simple MAC address changer created for Linux systems.


## Commented code
There is one .py file with the code fully commented (for educational purposes) and another .py file that contains only the code with necessary comments (if you don't see both files, it's because it is in progress).


## How to use the script?

- The user can chose which interface he wants to change the MAC address (-i, --interface) and then provide the desired MAC address (-m, --mac);
- Still, the user has the option to use a random generated MAC address provided by the script (-r, --random);
- If the user don't pass any arguments, the script will ask for the user to input the pending information;
- This script needs to run as sudo or root, otherwise the user will get an error;
- This code is meant to work with Python3.


Example 1 - Specifing the interface and the MAC address: 
```
sudo ./linuxmacchanger.py -i eth0 -m 00:11:22:33:44:55
```
Example 2 - Specifing only that the user wants a random generated MAC address
```
sudo ./linuxmacchanger.py -r
```
